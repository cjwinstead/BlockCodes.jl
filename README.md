# BlockCodes.jl

[![Build Status](https://github.com/cjwinstead/BlockCodes.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/cjwinstead/BlockCodes.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

A library for modeling and simulating Block Error Correcting Codes with Julia.
This library is designed for codes over Galois fields defined by a parity-check
matrix. The library also offers Modulation models including ASK, PSK, and QAM, 
and AWGN channels, and SyndromeDecoder look-up-tables for small codes.

This library is in an early stage of development. Documentation, tests and examples
are limited.
